<center><br><font face="Monospace">I figured it'd get annoying for users to have to constantly check every page for changes to see if something was updated, so I'll post all github updates in this brank new announcements page!</font></br></center>

<center><br><font face="Monospace">In the most recent update, I worked on making 8BM functional again. It's still not quite there, but I'm working on it!</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">BECOME OP is currently in it's final testing phase, and should be ready for download shortly. The walkthrough page has also had a lot of work done!</font></br></center>

<center><br><font face="Monospace">Hey there, and thanks for returning to the invinciblespeed announcements.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">Not much usable stuff has been added, most of today's work went into partly completed features that will come to the site in the near future.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">Since almost all of the BECOME OP area is done, my focus will not be put towards Don't Wake the Orb and 8BM.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">A new feature called NANDNET will be coming soon when I figure out how to use PHP.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">That's all for now. Stay safe out there, bud.</font></br></center>

<center><br><font face="Monospace">Announcements for updates every day may be going away soon enough.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">Instead of updating one little thing every day, I may start to release big updates to the site whenever I feel they're ready.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">If all goes according to plan, the last dialy update will be around the release of BECOME OP.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">Today's update included more stuff that isn't open to the general public yet, as well as an update to 8BM.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">That's all for now. Stay safe out there, bud.</font></br></center>

<center><br><font face="Monospace">Did I surprise you getting to this page?</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">That's right, I'm working on a proper catalog for all the announcements!</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">On top of that, tomorrow's update will bring plently of content to the site, so keep an eye out for that.</font></br></center>
<center><br><font face="Monospace">All that I've added today is what you just saw, some more behind the scenes work, and updates to 8BM</font></br></center>
